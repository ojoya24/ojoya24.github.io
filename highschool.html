										<h3 class="major">High School Visitation (HSV) Weekend</h3>
										<p>Underrepresented high school students are invited to spend a weekend on campus to learn about higher education opportunities and strategies to help maximize their potential. Students attend workshops, participate in team building activities, and listen to guest speakers. The majority of our workshops deal with leading concerns that high school students have such as scholarships, financial aid, test scores, uncertainty in deciding a career path, fitting in socially, and the advantages of stepping into secondary education. Students also receive the opportunity to experience college life by sleeping in dormitories, attending lectures, visiting campus facilities, and interacting with college students.</p>
										<p>Fall HSV is open to all high school students, while Spring HSV is restricted to high school seniors who have been accepted into the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>
										<p>If you have any questions, please contact Oscar Ortiz at shpe.uiuc.outreach@gmail.com.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Shadow Program</h2>
										<p>The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) and La Casa at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign joined forces in an effort to launch a shadow program for minority high school students in the Chicagoland Area. Those who are interested in UIUC, or college in general, will be invited to come down to campus and shadow a college student throughout their day, including lunch in one of our dining halls. Please note that this program will not be restricted to only students who are interested in Engineering! Contact the HSO chair at the email above to set up a Shadow Day with a student in your interested major.</p>
