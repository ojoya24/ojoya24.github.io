										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/com02.jpg" alt="" /></span>

										<h3>Fundraising</h3>
										<h4 class="major">Sundays | 1:00pm - 2:00pm </h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/com03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										The Fundraising committee is dedicated to generating funds within the University. We plan and execute all kinds of fundraisers from selling tamales on the quad to working a concession stand at ILLINI basketball home games. The funds generated from our sales go towards various SHPE|UIUC endeavors. Some fundraisers will have their proceeds donated to a charity and some will be kept to fund SHPE|UIUC. We use the funds to purchase equipment for the office or necessities for other committees. Other committees depend on corporate sponsors and our fundraising so they can run their programs or activites such as the chapter's HSV Program or to host this website. Also, our fundraising is sometimes used to subsidize SHPE|UIUC gear or conference travel.</p>

										<h3>Web Development</h3>
										<h4 class="major">TBD</h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/com04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										If you're looking to add web-development to your list of skills, observe how web-development is done, or are simply an experienced web developer looking to help with SHPE|UIUC's website then this is the committee for you. The Web Dev Committee works to meet the internet-driven, technological needs of SHPE|UIUC's e-board and general body. This often is in the form of updates to this website with new features or complete redesigns. We require no prior experience from an interested member.</p>
										<p>Through the committee you'll gain experience that can be applied to a career in web development. The committee follows professional level practices to give our members practical experience. The Web Dev committee uses Github as a repository, code review system, and an issue tracker. Futhermore, our meetings are half Agile/Scrum and half teaching. The website is also built on the Rails Framework, currently one of the most popular web application frameworks.</p>

										<h3 style="text-align: right">External Committee</h3>
										<h4 class="major" style="text-align: right">Mondays | 5:00 - 6:00 pm</h4>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/com05.jpg" alt=""/></span>
										The External committee helps members develop the professional skills they need to obtain and excel at the internship, research, or full time position they want. It is in charge of building and maintaining relationships with top engineering companies, so our members can have the opportunity to interact with corporate representatives through various events. The committee organizes many events throughout the year, such as corporate sponsored general body meetings, company socials, and professional workshops to improve resumes and interviewing skills. The committee is responsible for obtaining sponsorship for our society from different corporations.</p>

										<h3>Technical Projects</h3>

										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/com06.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										SHPE's Technical Projects Committee was founded with the purpose of exposing Engineers to real world problems and projects. Each year SHPE's Technical Projects Committee takes on on multiple projects ranging from robots for the Jerry Sanders Design Competition to smaller including for the Engineering Open House exhibits. The projects will be displayed in the Engineering Open House at the University of Illinois. During EOH, the projects will be displayed in the Mechanical Engineering Building where our projects are displayed in the Mechanical Engineering Building. The Technical Projects Committee is where a lot of students get their first taste of hands on engineering that will serve them well in their careers.<p>

										<h3>New Member Round Table</h3>
										<h4 class="major">Sundays | 5:00pm - 6:00pm </h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/com07.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										The Roundtable (RT) was created in the 1993-94 year in order to develop new SHPE members into leaders of the organization. The RT works by creating a microcosm of the chapter. It is composed of mainly freshman but is open to any new members. The committee then elects its own e-board. Throughout the school year, members of the RT, elected or not, think of and plan multiple events focused around SHPE's five pillars (Academics, Community Outreach, Chapter Development, Leadership and Professional Development).</p>
