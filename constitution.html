										<h2 class="major">Preamble</h2>
										<p>In order to aid Hispanics and other minorities toward achieving a degree in engineering, science, or math, we the founding members, have united to form an organization at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign by the name of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE|UIUC).</p>

										<p>It will be the primary goal of SHPE|UIUC to help and provide assistance towards fellow Hispanic students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, through our combined cooperative efforts and resources in the pursuit of similar goals. The gathering of members will consist of tutorial sessions, informational workshops, service programs, and organizational formal and informal meetings.</p>

										<p>Realizing the difficult road that Hispanics face in these fields, and the lack of role models, it is in the best interest of SHPE|UIUC to establish a foundation in which these goals will be achieved by every member of the organization.</p>
