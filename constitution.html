										<h2 class="major">Preamble</h2>
										<p>In order to aid Hispanics and other minorities toward achieving a degree in engineering, science, or math, we the founding members, have united to form an organization at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign by the name of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE|UIUC).</p>

										<p>It will be the primary goal of SHPE|UIUC to help and provide assistance towards fellow Hispanic students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, through our combined cooperative efforts and resources in the pursuit of similar goals.

										<p>Realizing the difficult road that Hispanics face in these fields, and the lack of role models, it is in the best interest of SHPE|UIUC to establish a foundation in which these goals will be achieved by every member of the organization.</p>
